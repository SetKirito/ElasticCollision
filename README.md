# Elastic Collision Research Program

This program simulates elastic collisions between two objects and provides an interactive environment to explore the effects of different parameters such as speed, mass, radius, surfaces, and materials on the collision dynamics.

## Features

- Simulate elastic collisions between two objects with adjustable parameters.
- Change the initial velocity, mass, and radius of both objects.
- Explore the effects of different materials on collision outcomes.
- Customize the restitution coefficient for each object and the surrounding walls.
- Analyze the changes in kinetic energy during and after collisions.
- Interactive UI with real-time updates and visualizations.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred C# development environment.
3. Run the program to launch the simulation interface.
4. Adjust the parameters using the provided controls.
5. Click the "Start" button to initiate the simulation and observe the collision dynamics.
6. Use the "Stop" button to pause the simulation and reset the objects.

## Usage

- Adjust the initial velocity, mass, and radius using the provided numeric inputs.
- Select materials from the dropdown lists to change the restitution coefficient and friction coefficient of the objects and surfaces.
- Observe real-time updates of velocity, kinetic energy, and collision behavior.
- Press the "Start" button to begin the simulation, and "Stop" to pause it.
- Use the "Reset" button to return objects to their default positions and velocities.
